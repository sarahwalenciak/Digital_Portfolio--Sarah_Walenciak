<h1>Distant Reading Project</h1>

<p> For this project, I chose The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed as the text to analyze between Voyant and Copilot. Below, the results from Voyant are embedded and can be interactively explored.</p>

<p> Now, here are the responses from Copilot.</p>

<p> I thought this text would be interesting to use for this project when I remembered it from the chatbot module, since there's something kind of cool and ironic about using computerized tools to analyze computer generated text. A difference I noticed between the two tools is that Voyant shows that many of the most common words in the text are names such as Helene, John, and Mathew, but Copilot seemed to overlook that aspect entirely (though that may have been a result of my asking broad questions rather than specific details about the text.) Another notable difference between Voyant and Copilot is that Voyant merely shows you the patterns contained in the text without implying how those patterns should be interpreted, while Copilot provides its own "take" on the text and leads you through your analysis with suggestions of what it should do next. However, a limitation of Voyant that Copilot doesn't seem to suffer from is that it doesn't filter out any irrelevant text from the websites you upload to it. The pdf I sent to Copilot was the exact same webpage used to make the corpus on Voyant, simply downloaded as a pdf using a web extension. The Voyant corpus ended up containing a lot of alt text from the Internet Archive page, while Copilot was able to ignore it and solely focus on the content of the book. I think the most intriguing response from Copilot was the comparison between Racter's style and its own. Despite, or maybe because of the much simpler and manually defined patterns driving Racter, its style reads as much more evocative and authentic to me. Of course, something like “the love of steak and lettuce” hardly makes sense, and Racter didn’t cite “philosophers from Plato to contemporary thinkers” in support of its argument, but somehow it just speaks to me more. Maybe it’s just that the modern AI style has become so ubiquitous that spotting it leaves the text feeling flat regardless of what it’s actually saying. Or maybe I just miss being able to use em dashes in my writing, since for whatever reason it’s become the hallmark of AI generated text.  </p>
