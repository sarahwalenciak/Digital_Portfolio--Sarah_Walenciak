# Welcome!
My name's Sarah, and this is my portfolio page. I'm in the process of completing my Digital Media degree at UCF, on the program track specializing in game design. I've utilized and become proficient with a wide variety of digital tools during the course of my studies, from both coursework and independent learning. The various works and projects showcased here will demonstrate some of these skills, and hopefully, they'll be things others can enjoy. This website is very much a work in progress, and much more will be added to it in the near future. Stay tuned!
