<h2> Abstract </h2>

<p> Much has already been said about the alt-right pipeline, or more broadly, far-right online radicalization.  These terms are contentious among researchers given their lack of clear definition and tendency to oversimplify the complex pathways through which individuals encounter, interpret, and are potentially drawn into extremist ideologies. As Marwick et al. observe, “there is no one way in which people are ‘radicalized’” and “recruits slowly adopt the identities, emotions, and interpretations shared by a community” rather than being transformed by mere exposure to content (2). Although the internet doesn't directly lead people to adopt extremist beliefs, it undeniably plays a significant role in the process. It serves as a powerful facilitator, providing access to ideological material, opportunities for networking, and pathways for deeper engagement with violent groups (Gaudette et al. 1344). </p>
<p> The far-right's online presence is a vast, dynamic, and multifaceted phenomenon. Understanding the internal workings of these online groups is crucial, particularly given their documented links to real-world events. For example, many of the “Unite the Right” demonstrators who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 organized through chats on Discord, a group-chat platform originally intended for video game communities (Baele et al. 1610). Discord's semi-private "server" communities and loose moderation initially provided an ideal environment for right-wing individuals to connect, share ideological content, and delve into extremist movements within what they perceived as a secure space. (Gallagher et al. 4). However, chat logs from many of these servers have since been leaked to the public, offering unredacted views into the internal communications of far-right servers that were previously inaccessible to researchers. </p>
<p> The primary data for this project was obtained from the Project Whispers data leak, a massive archive of Discord chat logs and metadata released by the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets). Project Whispers contains over 9.8 million messages pulled from 145 private Discord servers used by neo-Nazis, QAnon adherents, and other far-right extremists. These were chat logs spanning several years (circa 2017–2019), originating from invite-only Discord communities where members of the alt-right, white supremacists, and conspiracy theorists communicated under the assumption of secrecy. In their analysis of the Project Whispers data, researchers Waters and Van Gerwen highlight the "uncensored and frequently unhinged expression" of conspiracy theories and racist ideology within these servers, which they find troubling for contemporary American politics (1). </p>
<p>  For this project, a subset of data was extracted focusing specifically on "vetting" channels from the larger Project Whispers archive. These channels serve as gatekeeping mechanisms where prospective members must demonstrate ideological alignment to gain full access to the server. The data was collected by identifying administrator-posted prompts and gathering users' responses. From these, I selected questions and responses relating to the source of users’ beliefs to be analyzed, such as variations of the questions "What led you to national socialism?" or "What brought you to your current ideology?" This process created a dataset of self-reported narratives of radicalization, highlighting the texts, events, and influences that users attribute to shaping their beliefs. To analyze the textual patterns and recurring themes within these narratives, the extracted responses were uploaded to Voyant Tools as a corpus of documents. The “title” of each document is the question being responded to, and the username of the respondent is shown in parentheses as the “author.” </p>
